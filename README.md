## Setup

<a id="setup"></a>

We check the reproducibility under this environment.

+ Python 3.8.18
+ CUDA 11.1

To run the codes, you need to install the requirements:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chenxn2020/GOSE.git
cd GOSE

conda create -n gose python=3.8
conda activate gose
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

## Model Preparation

<a id="model-preparation"></a>

We utilize [LayoutXLM](https://github.com/microsoft/unilm/blob/master/layoutxlm/README.md) and [LiLT](https://github.com/jpWang/LiLT/tree/main) as our backbone.
You can download the models and place them under the `GOSE/`.

## Train GOSE

<a id="train-gose"></a>

We provide example scripts for explaining the usage of our code. You can kindly run the following commands.

+ ### Language-specific Fine-tuning

```bash
# Current path:  */GOSE
bash standard.sh
```

+ ### Multilingual fine-tuning

```bash
# Current path:  */GOSE
bash multi.sh
```

## Acknowledgment

The repository benefits greatly from [unilm/layoutlmft](https://github.com/microsoft/unilm/tree/master/layoutlmft) and [LiLT](https://github.com/jpWang/LiLT/tree/main). Thanks a lot for their excellent work.
